         <button class="accordion">Social identity and decision-making under uncertainty
</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this paper, I analyse how modal decisions within social groups  influence decision-making under uncertainty.  Specifically, I study how these modal decision are more often taken by members of the group as uncertainty increases. In a theoretical model, in which distancing from group's modal decision is penalised as a regret cost, I find that aligning with the in-group's modal decision  happens more often the higher is the identification with the group and it is also more frequent  under ambiguity than under risk. I design and run an online experiment  with a sample of US citizens in which social groups are formed through  political affiliation.  Results show that higher self-identification with the group leads to higher alignment with the group's modal decision and higher uncertainty (about the probability of the states of the world) generates an even stronger alignment with this decision for those with a high self-identification with the group.

        <button class="accordion">Preferences over the timing of uncertainty resolution under risk and ambiguity: an experimental approach

</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>This paper empirically analyses two types of preferences over the timing of resolution of uncertainty: preferences between early or late resolution and preferences between one-shot and gradual resolution of lotteries under risk and ambiguity. In an online experiment with students, we find significant differences between treatments: under risk, a majority of participants show a strict preference against gradual resolution of uncertainty, for low, medium and high ex-ante probabilities of receiving the prize of the lottery. Under ambiguity, most participants show a preference for gradual resolution of uncertainty for lotteries with a low-likelihood of winning, and an aversion towards it for medium and high likelihoods. Additionally, in both treatments we find subjects show strict preferences more frequently in the one-shot vs. gradual resolution dimension than in the early vs. late resolution dimension. Results from the experiment shed further light on the empirical validity of ambiguity models.
